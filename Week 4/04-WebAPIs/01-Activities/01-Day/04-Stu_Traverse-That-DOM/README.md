# Traverse That DOM

In this activity you are going to use the WebAPI and the `.style.property` to change the styling of elements on our page.

## Instructions

* Create an `script.js`

* Using the provided `index.html`, complete the following

  * Target the div with the ID of `articles`. Change its font size to `50px`.

    * Inside 'articles', change the h3 to have a font color of `blue`. 

  * Target the div with the ID of `main`. Change its background color to 'black'.

    * Inside 'main', change the h1 to have text-decoration  underline, color orange, and font size 80px.

    * Inside 'main', change the h2 to have font size 50px;

## Hint

* You may need to add some IDs, or use nested selectors!

## Bonus

* Change 3 other elements styles that we did not ask for above.
