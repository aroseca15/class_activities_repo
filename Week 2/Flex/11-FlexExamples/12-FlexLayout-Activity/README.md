# Flex Your Muscles - WAIT

* Using `index.html` and `style.css` as a starting point, work together to create the missing CSS necessary to form the layout shown to you on screen. 

* Slight differences, but hopefully easier! 

* Hint: You will need to apply each of the following CSS properties at least once:

  * padding

  * margin

  * background

  * display

  * width (read up on width by percents)

  * color

  * flex-wrap

  * align-items

  * flex-direction

  * height

  * font-size

  * line-height

* If you finish early Slack the TAs. TAs will reassign you to help others in the class.
